# SteamMarketAnalyzerExtension
Steam market chrome (or similar browser) extension that scans through prices on the steam market page you have open and prints to console what are considered "good" deals (float values for prices much lower than the rest). Includes python graphing that can give you more detailed trend analysis for given skins.
